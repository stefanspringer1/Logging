# Logging

This is a small multi-platform logging library.

This logging library was specifically designed to allow users to quickly get started with the [Pipeline](https://github.com/stefanspringer1/PipelineLogging) library. However, it can also be used independently of the Pipeline library.

In order to use this library with the Pipeline libary, you also need the [PipelineLogging](https://github.com/stefanspringer1/PipelineLogging) library which implements a binding to the Pipeline library. It suffices to then add the PipelineLogging libary as a dependency.
